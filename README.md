# Introduction to PostgreSQL
This is a small introduction to how databases work on an entery level. The gerneral idea of this course came up during the database course we had at the university. We quickly came to realise that there is a hugh room for improvement during these lectures. Therefor we decided to create some of our own to help our classmates with the understanding of the basic principles of databases.

The main focus is to get a grip on PostgreSQL, and how to write some basic SQL related to this RDBMS.

The live presentations will be held in our class discord, following the schedual that Arvid or Ellie will publish in our Discord.
