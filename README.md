# Introduction to PostgreSQL
This is a small introduction to how databases work at an entry-level. The general idea of this course came up during the database course we had at the university. However, we quickly realised that there was a vast room for improvement during these lectures. Therefore we created some of our own to help our classmates understand the principles of databases.

The main focus is to get a grip on PostgreSQL and how to write some essential SQL related to this RDBMS.

*The live presentations will be held in our class discord, following the schedule that Arvid or Ellie will publish in our Discord.*

## Recommended tools:
* PGAdmin 4 (sometimes referred to as POGAdmin)
